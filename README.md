# FiveM Console Commands for Streamer.bot
<img style="width: 25%" src="logo.png">

This allows you send console commands from Streamer.bot to the FiveM client, without needing to open the console itself.

## Installation

1. Import the [FiveM-Console.sb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhazzItToYa/Streamerbot-FiveM/refs/heads/main/FiveM-Console.sb) import string into Streamer.bot as normal

## Usage

In a Streamer.bot action:
* Set the argument `consoleCommand` to the FiveM console command you want to run.
* Run Action "Send FiveM Console Command", with Run Immediately = Checked.

The import includes a couple of sample actions that set the crosshair to different styles.

## Acknowledgements
